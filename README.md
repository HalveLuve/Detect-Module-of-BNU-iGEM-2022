>   Stochastic Simulation Version

This is the stochastic simulation version of the **Detect Module** designed by our team BNU-China 2022. It's, in respect to biology, a Two-component System (TCS) modified for detecting Î”9-THC in human body, which is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. There are several other modules included in the project as well but this is the one I'm assigned to (at least currently :D). Feel free to contact me at 202011081001@mail.bnu.edu.cn if any question occurs.

Basically, it's based on the **Gillespie/SSA algorithm**, which is usually adopted in the fields of computational biology and chemistry, etc. But as the situation in our project is rather complicated (or exactly, "real"), the open-source versions online are mostly not ideal when simulation. So I came up with this **MODIFIED** version of Gillespie algorithm.
